      <div class="answer">
        I spent most of my time scrolling through and reading about the many

        Q5: What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        My impression of the intended primary goal was: to take a look at past
        projects and get a sense of proficiency pertaining to her area of
        expertise
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        The website communicates this via interactive preview sections which
        re-directs the user to pages discussing her entire story and processes
        behind the project
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        Q6: How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </div>
      <div id="q7">
        Q7: What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? <i>(For how long and how many different times)</i>
      </div>
      <div id="q7a">
        <p>
          My impression is that the website should be interacted with one or two
          times to explore and read over the work that Min has contributed to.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe the time spent on her page would be within an hour as her
          primary goal of showing her works is formatted very directly. Adding
          to this, Min places a “See My Resume” button, which is located at the
          beginning of the main page, which almost instantly allows users to
          observe her resume
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Her projects each have a date that they were completed. This suggests to
        users that Min is still indulging in her area of work and can expect
        some sort of update to her website in the future. Knowing that the last
        project uploaded was in 2024, users are inclined to revisit her page
        once every few months

      <div class="question">
        Q8: How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        Q9: What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Email and LinkedIn, located at the bottom at every page. Requires the
        user to scroll completely down, of every page, to find them
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Communicates to me that I should have great freedom to browse through
        content and decide on what captures my interest

      <div class="question">
