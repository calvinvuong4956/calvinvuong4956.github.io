          Q1: What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </p>
        <p>The big title and giant graphic</p>

        <p class="bold">
          Q2: Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Buttons: Explore Project + See My Resume</li>
          <li>The ability to scroll</li>
          <li>Clickable boxes that redirect you to the previewed content</li>
          <li>
            Home Icon top right, sends you back to the top of the main page
          </li>
          <li>
            Clickable <i>“Projects”</i> label top left, sends you to a page
            exclusively showing projects completed
          </li>
          <li>
            Clickable <i>“About”</i> label top left, send you to a page showing
            information related to Min Jea Seo’s career
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="bold">
          Q3: What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent most of my time scrolling through and reading about the many
          projects that Min had worked on
        </p>

        <p class="bold">
          Q4:What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
          the experience?
        </p>
        <p>Clicking - clicking boxes, icons and labels</p>

        <p class="bold">
          Q5: What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </p>
        <p>
          My impression of the intended primary goal was: to take a look at past
          projects and get a sense of proficiency pertaining to her area of
          expertise
        </p>

        <p class="bold">
          Q6: How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </p>
        <p>
          The website communicates this via interactive preview sections which
          re-directs the user to pages discussing her entire story and processes
          behind the project
        </p>

        <p class="bold">
          Q7: What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? <i>(For how long and how many different times)</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          My impression is that the website should be interacted with one or two
          times to explore and read over the work that Min has contributed to.
          <span
            >I believe the time spent on her page would be within an hour as her
            primary goal of showing her works is formatted very directly. Adding
            to this, Min places a “See My Resume” button, which is located at
            the beginning of the main page, which almost instantly allows users
            to observe her resume</span
          >
        </p>

        <p class="bold">
          Q8: How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </p>
        <p>
          Her projects each have a date that they were completed. This suggests
          to users that Min is still indulging in her area of work and can
          expect some sort of update to her website in the future. Knowing that
          the last project uploaded was in 2024, users are inclined to revisit
          her page once every few months
        </p>

        <p class="bold">
          Q9: What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?
        </p>
        <p>
          Email and LinkedIn, located at the bottom at every page. Requires the
          user to scroll completely down, of every page, to find them
        </p>

        <p class="bold">
          Q10: What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you
          should act when engaging with your research experience?
        </p>
        <p>
          Communicates to me that I should have great freedom to browse through
          content and decide on what captures my interest
        </p>

        <p class="bold">
          Q11: What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you
          should feel when engaging with your research experience?
        </p>
        <p>
          The interactive elements and designs give me a sense of comfort and
          curiosity
        </p>

        <p class="bold">
          Q12: What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part frustrating?
        </p>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YLRGOdm.png" alt="Spelling Error" />
        <p><i>“Desgin”</i>spelling error</p>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QtAzeUv.png" alt="See My Resume" />
        <p>
          Confused about the purpose of <i>“Up-down”</i> arrows when there is no
          additional content to scroll up/down to within the block besides
          <i>“See My Resume →” </i>
          <span
            >The arrows seem unnecessary but possibly are implemented there for
            future updates where additional content might be added into the
            block. However, since currently there is no additional content, I
            believe the “arrows” line of code should be hidden</span
          >
          <span
            >Excluding these minor details, I have no other issues with the
            interaction</span
          >
        </p>

        <p class="bold">
          What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
          makes that part satisfying?
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Quick accessibility to main pages through a static header tab
            located in every page
          </li>
          <li>
            Simplistic design: format + colour palette
            <i>(grey, white, black)</i>
          </li>
          <li>Easy readability: Readable font type and font size</li>
          <li>
            Soft-touch of casual playfulness, expressed through the soft
            font-type, rounded boxes, pleasant colour contrast between grey,
            white and black, and cutesy emojis and graphics
          </li>
        </ul>
