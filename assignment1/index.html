        Q2: Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        Q3: What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        I spent most of my time scrolling through and reading about the many
        projects that Min had worked on
      </div>
      <div class="answer">Clicking - clicking boxes, icons and labels</div>
      <div class="question">
        Q4:What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        Q5: What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        My impression of the intended primary goal was: to take a look at past
        projects and get a sense of proficiency pertaining to her area of
        expertise
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        The website communicates this via interactive preview sections which
        re-directs the user to pages discussing her entire story and processes
        behind the project
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        Q6: How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </div>
      <div id="q7">
        Q7: What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? <i>(For how long and how many different times)</i>
      </div>
      <div id="q7a">
        <p>
          The website should be interacted with one or two times to explore and
          read over Min's work
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe the time spent on her page would be within an hour as her
          primary goal of showing her works is formatted very directly. Adding
          to this, Min places a <i>“See My Resume”</i> button, which is located
          at the beginning of the main page, which almost instantly allows users
          to observe her resume
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Her projects each have a date that they were completed. This suggests to
        users that Min is still indulging in her area of work and can expect
        some sort of update to her website in the future. Knowing that the last
        project uploaded was in 2024, users are inclined to revisit her page
        once every few months
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        Q8: How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </div>
      <div id="q9">
        Q9: What other media forms <i>(digital or otherwise)</i>does the
        experience reference?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Email and LinkedIn, located at the bottom at every page. Requires the
        user to scroll completely down, of every page, to find them
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Communicates to me that I should have great freedom to browse through
        content and decide on what captures my interest
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        Q10: What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        Q11: What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        The interactive elements and designs give me a sense of comfort and
        curiosity
      </div>

          Q12: What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part frustrating?
        </div>
      </section>
      <p1>
        <p><i>“Desgin”</i> spelling error</p>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/YLRGOdm.png" alt="Spelling Error" />

        <p id="arrow">
          Confused about the purpose of <i>“Up-down”</i> arrows when there is no
          additional content to scroll up/down to within the block besides
          <i>“See My Resume →” </i>
          <span
            >The arrows seem unnecessary but possibly are implemented there for
            future updates where additional content might be added into the
            block. However, since currently there is no additional content, I
            believe the “arrows” line of code should be hidden</span
          >
          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QtAzeUv.png" alt="See My Resume" />
          Excluding these minor details, I have no other issues with the
          interaction

        <ul>
          <li>
            Quick accessibility to main pages through a static header tab
            located in every page
          </li>
          <li>
            Simplistic design: format + colour palette
            <i>(grey, white, black)</i>
          </li>
          <li>Easy readability: Readable font type and font size</li>
          <li>
            Soft-touch of casual playfulness, expressed through the soft
            font-type, rounded boxes, pleasant colour contrast between grey,
            white and black, and cutesy emojis and graphics
